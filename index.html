			<div id="hometeam_work_text" class="work_text"> Hometeam is changing home healthcare by empowering caregivers and improving health outcomes for seniors. As Product Manager of Revenue Operations, I've worked on our back office tools team to build out our invoicing, payroll, and electronic payments platform. By introducing electronic payments, I reduced our bad debt from 12% of revenue to under 1%. I spearheaded the development of our insurance billing product to automate the preparation and faxing of materials to insurance. This resulted in increasing our operational capacity by 30 hours/week.</div>
